# General information
## Description
This project has the example code, written by me, from the Drupal 7 Module Development book (1st edition) and has just been used to help me learn the subject better.

# Branch structure
I've created a new branch for each example, some chapters have multiple revisision of the same example. Each of those revisions have been put on a separate branch too but are named so you can identify which draft it is and which chapter it is from.
## Branches
* Chapter 2
    * chapter2-first-module
* Chapter 4
    * chapter4-single-blog
    * chapter4-single-blog--draft2 
    * chapter4-single-blog--draft3
