# General information
## Description
This project has the example code, written by me, from the Drupal 7 Module Development book (1st edition) and has just been used to help me learn the subject better.

# Branch structure
I've created a new branch for each example, some chapters have multiple revisision of the same example. Each of those revisions have been put on a separate branch too but are named so you can identify which draft it is and which chapter it is from.
## Branches
* Chapter 2
    * chapter2-first-module
* Chapter 4
    * chapter4-single-blog
    * chapter4-single-blog--draft2 
    * chapter4-single-blog--draft3
* Chapter 5
    * chapter5-admin-interface (unable to get this working)

#Problems
##Chapter 5
I've been unable to get the Chapter 5 example working, when I go to /admin/people, click a user then click the "Warn" tab it just tells me the requested page could not be found.

If you have any ideas feel free to let me know.
